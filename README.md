# Learning C++

Taking [Learn to Program with C++ 17](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learn-program-cplusplus)


> Module 1 & 2 were setting up MSYS64 and G++ compiler in VSCode


## Things I've learned so far:
* Setting up G++ on Windows
* Header files and creating multiple files for a single executable
* VSCode compiling multiple files for an executable
  * See `.vscode/tasks.json`
