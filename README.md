# ðŸ’» Learning C++

> Module 1 & 2 were setting up MSYS64 and G++ compiler in VSCode

Taking [Learn to Program with C++ 17](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learn-program-cplusplus)

### ðŸ’¡ Things I've learned so far:
* Setting up G++ on Windows
* Header files and creating multiple files for a single executable
* VSCode compiling multiple files for an executable
  * See `.vscode/tasks.json`
* VSCode compiler for operating system specific gcc / g++ 
* A class should, _typically_, have a header file with the same name
* Header file class declarations must end a semicolon (TIL)
* Not to assume that main will always need every / all header file(s)
