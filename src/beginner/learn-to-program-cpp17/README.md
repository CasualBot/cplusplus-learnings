# ðŸ’» Learning C++

> Module 1 & 2 were setting up mingw64 and g++/gcc/gdb 

Taking [Learn to Program with C++ 17](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/learn-program-cplusplus) by [@KateGregory](https://github.com/KateGregory)

## ðŸ’¡ Things I've learned so far

* Setting up G++ on Windows
* Header files and creating multiple files for a single executable
* VSCode compiling multiple files for an executable
  * See `.vscode/tasks.json`
* VSCode compiler for operating system specific gcc / g++
* A class should, _typically_, have a header file with the same name
* Header file class declarations must end a semicolon (TIL)
* Not to assume that main will always need every / all header file(s)
* `makefile`! So much nicer than configuring `tasks.json`
